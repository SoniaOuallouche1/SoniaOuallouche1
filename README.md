## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Welcome to my GitHub

I'm currently studying to have my degree to work on web development.
After almost a year of learning new things I didn't even know about before, I learned so much methods that improved my stack to be a great developer and I would like to share it!

Let me explain you what I learned, how I practised and why I can say, now, that I'm a real developer.
